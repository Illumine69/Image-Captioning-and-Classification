# Some information before running the files

This assignment has two files, `main.py` and `transformed_images.py` which perform two parts of the `Analysis Task` respectively.

- I have used `import os` to use os library to create a new directory where transformed images will be stored in the `output` folder.
- Since my Roll. No. is 21CS10057 , I've used `7.jpg` as base image on which various tranformations have been done and saved. You can change the Roll. No. in the `experiment` function of `main.py` to use a different image which has same last digit as Roll No.
- The path where transformed images will be saved can be set by the user. For this, change the `path` variable in the `main` function of `transformed_images.py`.
- I have generated two extra images `h_7.jpg` and `i_7.jpg` to showcase center and random cropping since it was missing in the problem statement but asked to implement.
- I have provided the sample images along with the transformed images already. To see that the code itself downloads and save these in appropriate places, delete them and run the code.
- I have assumed the user have all the required libraries imported on the device. Otherwise, refer to [this](https://github.com/dasabir/CS29006_SW_Lab_Spr2023/blob/main/Python_DS_Assignment_Question_02/README.md#installation-instructions).
