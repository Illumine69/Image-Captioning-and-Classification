## Python GUI (tkinter)

We will design a GUI using `tkinter` which would have the following overall functionality:

* The GUI would provide the user to select a file from the computer.
* It will have a dropdown menu to toggle between two output options: `Image Captioning` and `Image Classification`
* If `Image Captioning` is selected then it should show the caption for the selected image file along with the original image file side-by-side.
* For `Image Classification` it should display the classification class instead of the captions.
* We will obtain the captions by taking help from the Image Captioning Model.
* For classification, we use Image Classification Model

Note: Please install **tkinter** and **functools** along with the required libraries mentioned [here](../Image_Transformation_and_Captioning/requirements.txt).
