# Image Captioning and Classification

This project is done to showcase how to use trained classification and captioning model to learn about images in Python

* The [Image_Transformation_and_Captioning](Image_Transformation_and_Captioning) section demonstrates the usage of some transformation functions to manipulate input image dataset to diversify it.     
Moreover, it provides a captioner model which provides caption for the stored images.   

* The [Tkinter_GUI](Tkinter_GUI) explains how to create a simple GUI for applying captioning and classification model on any input image.
